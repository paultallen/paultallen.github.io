    <h2>Paul T Allen - Projects with Undergraduate Students </h2>


    <ul>
     	<li>Summer 2017: I worked with students Karlie Schwartzwald and Sara Stout on discrete approximations of boundary value problems.</li>
     	<li> Summer 2016:  I worked with students Eli Barnes and Mack Beveridge on geometric flows for polygons.</li>
     	<li> Summer 2014:  Two students did independent research projects under my supervisition: Colin Gavin worked on mean curvature flow; Sam Stewart worked on numerical models of blowup phenomena for nonlinear waves.</li>
     	<li> Summer 2011:  I worked with Alison Fankhauser and Jenny Louthan creating numerical models for reaction-diffusion equations arising in chemistry.</li>
     	<li> Summer 2010:  I worked with Katie Tsukahara and Adam Layne studying the Dirichlet problem for curve shortening flow on spheres.</li>
    </ul>
